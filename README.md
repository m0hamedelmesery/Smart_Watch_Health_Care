## Introduction

With the increasing popularity of wearable technology, smartwatches have become a rich source of health data. This project focuses on analyzing this data to provide meaningful health insights. The key objectives include monitoring heart rate, sleep patterns, physical activity, and other vital signs to detect any anomalies and provide actionable recommendations.

## Data Collection

The data used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. You can access the dataset [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amankharwal/Website-data/master/dailyActivity_merged.csv).

## Data Analysis

The data analysis process includes the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning:** Preprocessing the raw data to handle missing values and outliers.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding the data through descriptive statistics and visualizations.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Creating relevant features for analysis.
4. **Visualization:** Generating plots and dashboards to visualize health metrics and analysis results.
